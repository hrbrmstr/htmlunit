Description: 'HtmlUnit' (<http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/>) is a "'GUI'-Less 
    browser for 'Java' programs". It models 'HTML' documents and provides an 'API' 
    that allows one to invoke pages, fill out forms, click links and more just like 
    one does in a "normal" browser. The library has fairly good and constantly
    improving 'JavaScript' support and is able to work even with quite complex 'AJAX' 
    libraries, simulating 'Chrome', 'Firefox' or 'Internet Explorer' depending on
    the configuration used. It is typically used for testing purposes or to retrieve 
    information from web sites. Tools are provided to work with this library
    at a higher level than provided by the exposed 'Java' libraries in the 
    'htmlunitjars' package.
